-- The 'normalize' function transforms Unicode text into an equivalent
-- composed or decomposed form, allowing for easier sorting and
-- searching of text.  'normalize' supports the standard normalization
-- forms described in <http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr15/>,
-- Unicode Standard Annex #15: Unicode Normalization Forms.
--
-- Characters with accents or other adornments can be encoded in
-- several different ways in Unicode.  For example, take the character A-acute.
-- In Unicode, this can be encoded as a single character (the
-- \"composed\" form):
--
-- @
--      00C1    LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH ACUTE
-- @
--
-- or as two separate characters (the \"decomposed\" form):
--
-- @
--      0041    LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A
--      0301    COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT
-- @
--
-- To a user of your program, however, both of these sequences should
-- be treated as the same \"user-level\" character \"A with acute
-- accent\".  When you are searching or comparing text, you must
-- ensure that these two sequences are treated equivalently.  In
-- addition, you must handle characters with more than one accent.
-- Sometimes the order of a character's combining accents is
-- significant, while in other cases accent sequences in different
-- orders are really equivalent.
--
-- Similarly, the string \"ffi\" can be encoded as three separate letters:
--
-- @
--      0066    LATIN SMALL LETTER F
--      0066    LATIN SMALL LETTER F
--      0069    LATIN SMALL LETTER I
-- @
--
-- or as the single character
--
-- @
--      FB03    LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FFI
-- @
--
-- The \"ffi\" ligature is not a distinct semantic character, and
-- strictly speaking it shouldn't be in Unicode at all, but it was
-- included for compatibility with existing character sets that
-- already provided it.  The Unicode standard identifies such
-- characters by giving them \"compatibility\" decompositions into the
-- corresponding semantic characters.  When sorting and searching, you
-- will often want to use these mappings.
--
-- 'normalize' helps solve these problems by transforming text into
-- the canonical composed and decomposed forms as shown in the first
-- example above.  In addition, you can have it perform compatibility
-- decompositions so that you can treat compatibility characters the
-- same as their equivalents.  Finally, 'normalize' rearranges accents
-- into the proper canonical order, so that you do not have to worry
-- about accent rearrangement on your own.
--
-- Form 'FCD', \"Fast C or D\", is also designed for collation.  It
-- allows to work on strings that are not necessarily normalized with
-- an algorithm (like in collation) that works under \"canonical
-- closure\", i.e., it treats precomposed characters and their
-- decomposed equivalents the same.
--
-- It is not a normalization form because it does not provide for
-- uniqueness of representation. Multiple strings may be canonically
-- equivalent (their NFDs are identical) and may all conform to 'FCD'
-- without being identical themselves.
--
-- The form is defined such that the \"raw decomposition\", the
-- recursive canonical decomposition of each character, results in a
-- string that is canonically ordered. This means that precomposed
-- characters are allowed for as long as their decompositions do not
-- need canonical reordering.
--
-- Its advantage for a process like collation is that all 'NFD' and
-- most 'NFC' texts - and many unnormalized texts - already conform to
-- 'FCD' and do not need to be normalized ('NFD') for such a
-- process. The 'FCD' 'quickCheck' will return 'Yes' for most strings
-- in practice.
--
-- @'normalize' 'FCD'@ may be implemented with 'NFD'.
--
-- For more details on 'FCD' see the collation design document:
-- <http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/icuhtml/trunk/design/collation/ICU_collation_design.htm>
--
-- ICU collation performs either 'NFD' or 'FCD' normalization
-- automatically if normalization is turned on for the collator
-- object.  Beyond collation and string search, normalized strings may
-- be useful for string equivalence comparisons,
-- transliteration/transcription, unique representations, etc.
--
-- The W3C generally recommends to exchange texts in 'NFC'.  Note also
-- that most legacy character encodings use only precomposed forms and
-- often do not encode any combining marks by themselves. For
-- conversion to such character encodings the Unicode text needs to be
-- normalized to 'NFC'.  For more usage examples, see the Unicode
-- Standard Annex.

-- to its normalized form and compare the results.

-- | Compare two strings for canonical equivalence.  Further options
-- include case-insensitive comparison and codepoint order (as
-- opposed to code unit order).
--
-- Canonical equivalence between two strings is defined as their
-- normalized forms ('NFD' or 'NFC') being identical.  This function
-- compares strings incrementally instead of normalizing (and
-- optionally case-folding) both strings entirely, improving
-- performance significantly.
--
-- Bulk normalization is only necessary if the strings do not fulfill
-- the 'FCD' conditions. Only in this case, and only if the strings
-- are relatively long, is memory allocated temporarily.  For 'FCD'
-- strings and short non-'FCD' strings there is no memory allocation.
